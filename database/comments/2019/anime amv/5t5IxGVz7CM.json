The world changes quickly and the two grow close, people start to believe less in spirits and in so the woman loses her grip on her powers. Her body is torn away from her and she against her will is turned into a cyborg. The son faces race discrimination all the while trying to help his friend regain her powers through mechanical means. With his help she is able to shapeshift once again and swears revenge on the disgusting men who hurt her and others like her.

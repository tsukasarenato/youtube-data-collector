And when it played 'honestly I thought that I'd be dead right now', young Isabella was being asked to become the next person to inherit the role as a mom, and there was a huge demon (I think their called).

I don’t agree with that. Isabella is neither good nor bad. She’s a victim of an evil system, and she did what she had to do to survive. She’s a survivor, that’s all. Unlike Emma, who much rather die than become part of that system, Isabella thought first and foremost of herself and that’s why she lost her humanity along the way. She hasn’t lost it completely because she felt glad the children escaped. However, she’s not good either. When the children escaped,they showed her another option and what you can accomplish if you’re willing to sacrifice even your life to help others. Even as a child, Isabella tried to escape, it seems, but she was trying to do it by herself, again, showing the difference between her and Emma.I haven’t read the manga, so I don’t know if we will see more of her or not. I hope we do and see how this has affected her. I like this series because characters are not so black or white.

It was probably hard to raise kids that you knew were going to be killed by yourself in a few years. You can see in the last episode how she told them to be safe. In the end she wanted them to have what she couldn’t. It is really sad actually and my theory in the second season is going to be she is gonna be a good guy more or less. I have a feeling she will probably not be able to do much since she can’t leave the wall, so after her job is done (helping the little kids get out in anyway she can) she will probably die.

I really like AMVs but most are poorly edited and just slap action scenes and music like that meant to fit, but this one is really good. The first 7 seconds is a great hook and makes me want to watch more.    A few things I would suggest  1- I don't think cutting out the song completely from the video then putting normal speech in fits very well, like at 0:57. 2- I really like when the feeling of the song and feel of the clips match it creates an awesome music video that seems like it the original, it's even better when it tells a story or points out a theme in the anime that might not be so apparent.   3- Since it is your first AMV I would watch som other AMV  channels and get some ideas, personally I think oMuStIiA's channel creates some really great AMVs. I Recommend watching  Dollhouse from their channel for some ideas.    Overall a great Stand alone AMV and even a better first start, you earned yourself a sub and I look forward to seeing more of your content in the future.", "date": "2020-01-16T09:27:54Z", "like": 2}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "BadLuck Nat", "comment": "Thanks for the tips!

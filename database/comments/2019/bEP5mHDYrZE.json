Isabella have a very deep past, she knows she went too far, she needs to sacrifice her children to survive long. She was lied as a child and her friend Leslie was the ones who made the Isabella's Lullaby, she says to Leslie to make the song he made as Isabella's Lullaby because she thinks it's a good idea. When she is getting shipped out/killed, Grandmother gave her a choice: Be the next mother, be a sister (like sister Krone) or die? Isabella found out her life was a lie and choose to be the next mother. She worked hard on the Grace Field, sacrificing her children to survive. When Ray sang her Lullaby, she gets a bit of flashbacks and she got back to her human self feeling bad. When Norman was getting shipped out, he said: Are you happy, mom? Isabella start to feel bad and go back to her human self for a while again. Yk when they escaped, she smiled because nobody have ever escaped from the Grace Field Farm. She still need to do it to survive so she did. She still works at Grace Field Farm sacrificing children from the Grace Field Farm.

When Emma and Norman left Little Bunny (the bunny stuffed animal) at the place with the car or whatever its called and Isabella (the mom) found it, she knew *someone* found out about what they were doing, she immediately suspected Emma, Norman, or Ray, and the line in the song, 'what do you know', is so perfectly placed, because that was when Isabella was asking Emma is she was ok, and she wasn't her cheery self. And when it played 'honestly I thought that I'd be dead right now', young Isabella was being asked to become the next person to inherit the role as a mom, and there was a huge demon (I think their called). Then during around the beginning of the video, where Emma and Norman were chatting and walking down stairs and it played 'what are you wondering', Isabella was watching them.

I don’t agree with that. Isabella is neither good nor bad. She’s a victim of an evil system, and she did what she had to do to survive. She’s a survivor, that’s all. Unlike Emma, who much rather die than become part of that system, Isabella thought first and foremost of herself and that’s why she lost her humanity along the way. She hasn’t lost it completely because she felt glad the children escaped. However, she’s not good either. When the children escaped,they showed her another option and what you can accomplish if you’re willing to sacrifice even your life to help others. Even as a child, Isabella tried to escape, it seems, but she was trying to do it by herself, again, showing the difference between her and Emma.I haven’t read the manga, so I don’t know if we will see more of her or not. I hope we do and see how this has affected her. I like this series because characters are not so black or white.

She lost all hope, everyone who was precious to her died and she knew that even her own son will die. In the end she let them escape. Of course she has her flaws and of course her choice was not „right“ and might‘ve even been considered as selfish, but there simply was no right choice.

It was probably hard to raise kids that you knew were going to be killed by yourself in a few years. You can see in the last episode how she told them to be safe. In the end she wanted them to have what she couldn’t. It is really sad actually and my theory in the second season is going to be she is gonna be a good guy more or less. I have a feeling she will probably not be able to do much since she can’t leave the wall, so after her job is done (helping the little kids get out in anyway she can) she will probably die.

I really like AMVs but most are poorly edited and just slap action scenes and music like that meant to fit, but this one is really good. The first 7 seconds is a great hook and makes me want to watch more.    A few things I would suggest  1- I don't think cutting out the song completely from the video then putting normal speech in fits very well, like at 0:57. 2- I really like when the feeling of the song and feel of the clips match it creates an awesome music video that seems like it the original, it's even better when it tells a story or points out a theme in the anime that might not be so apparent.   3- Since it is your first AMV I would watch som other AMV  channels and get some ideas, personally I think oMuStIiA's channel creates some really great AMVs. I Recommend watching  Dollhouse from their channel for some ideas.    Overall a great Stand alone AMV and even a better first start, you earned yourself a sub and I look forward to seeing more of your content in the future.", "date": "2020-01-16T09:27:54Z", "like": 2}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "BadLuck Nat", "comment": "Thanks for the tips!
